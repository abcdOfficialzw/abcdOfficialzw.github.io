								<h1>My Role</h1>
								<strong>Position: </strong>Lead Frontend Developer <br>
								<strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
									<ul>
										<li>Implementation of the web design from Figma into a functional user interface, ensuring a seamless transition from design to web.</li>

										<li>Establishment of email notifications to enhance user engagement and retention.</li>
									</ul>
